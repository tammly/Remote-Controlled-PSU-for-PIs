# Remote-Controlled-PSU-for-PIs
A PSU setup that will provide stable power to a couple dozen ARM boards with the ability to hard reset them remotely with a mixture of USB controls and GPIO. Power can be set up inline using the relays to disrupt power.  Power can also be set up directly to the ATX PSU and the relay can short the P6 reset jumpers on the Raspberry PIs.  This project will focus on the former set up described.

We will be using relay boards, ATX PSU, USB type-A connectors, push button switches and a Raspberry Pi for managing the setup. Python will be used as the language of choice.  Possibly add other languages as I learn them.

May be pointless to most people but i needed something to keep myself busy. :)
