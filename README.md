# Remote-Controlled-PSU-for-PIs
A PSU setup that will provide stable power to a couple dozen ARM boards with the ability to hard reset them remotely with a mixture of USB controls and GPIO. 

We will be using relay boards, ATX PSU, USB type-A connectors, push button switches and a Raspberry Pi for manageing the setup.

May be pointless to most people but i needed something to keep myself busy. :)
